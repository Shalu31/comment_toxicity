# comment_toxicity
This project develops a deep learning–based model in Python to detect and classify toxic comments (harassment, hate speech, offensive language) in real time. The system helps maintain healthier online communication by flagging harmful content for moderation.

## Problem Statement
Online communities and social media platforms have become integral to modern communication. However, toxic comments (harassment, hate speech, offensive language) pose challenges to healthy online discourse.  

The objective of this project is to **develop a deep learning-based comment toxicity detection model** using Python.  
This model will analyze online comments and predict the likelihood of toxicity, assisting moderators in taking actions such as filtering, user warnings, or further review.

## Business Use Cases
- **Social Media Platforms**: Real-time toxic comment detection & filtering.  
- **Online Forums & Communities**: Efficient content moderation.  
- **Content Moderation Services**: Enhanced moderation capabilities.  
- **Brand Safety & Reputation Management**: Ensures ads and content appear in safe spaces.  
- **E-learning Platforms**: Safer online learning environments.  
- **News & Media Outlets**: Automated moderation of user comments.

## Approach

### Data Exploration & Preparation
- Load and explore dataset  
- Perform text preprocessing: cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization  

### Model Development
- Train a deep learning model for toxicity detection  
- Experiment with **LSTM, CNN, or transformer-based models (BERT)**  
- Save trained model for deployment  

### Streamlit Application Development
- Build interactive UI to input comments and get predictions in real-time  
- Display **model performance metrics** and **data insights**  
- Provide CSV upload option for bulk predictions
